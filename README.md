In a Multi-Agent System (MAS), autonomous agents interact to pursue
personal interests and/or to achieve common objectives. Distributed
Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) in this regard, have emerged
as a prominent agent model to govern the agentsâ€™ autonomous behavior,
where both algorithms and communication models are driven by the structure
of the specific problem. A recent paper [19] offers a distributed local
search algorithm in order to solve an Asymmetric-DCOP (ADCOP) where
agents are partially cooperative (as opposed to the commonly used fullycooperative
and self-interested agents). Based on this approach, we propose
a novel implementation of these three heuristics, inspired by natural
human interactions, exhibiting an efficient message transferring mechanism
between agents. Our local search algorithm outperforms two popular
heuristics when measuring the sum of gains, and shows competitive results
when measuring the equality in the system. This study thus contributes
to the understanding of partial cooperation heuristics against the classic
approaches and provides interesting insights with regard to an equality
objective.
